                    <p>Every semester, students move in and out and they struggle to make the places they stay at school their second home. While they have access to places such as Craigslist and Facebook groups for the buying and selling of various items and furniture, the risk of trading with strangers or the need to travel a long distance can pose great inconvenience. We plan to provide the students and faculty at Purdue a platform to exclusively trade with others on the campus for their convenience while providing chances for users to socialize and make friends.</p>

                    <div>Why can I only sign up using my purdue email?</div>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>A key user group of initial focus for the project are exclusively Purdue University students and faculty members. This is because we want to create a safe and secure environment for Purdue students and faculty members to trade their goods within the University campus. By having only registered Purdue University students and faculty members involved in the trade, we can lessen the occurrence of scams as their Purdue identification can be used to hold more accountability towards their actions. We will verify our users by validating their Purdue e-mail addresses.</p>
